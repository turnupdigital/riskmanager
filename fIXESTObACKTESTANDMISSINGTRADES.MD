Thought for 30 seconds
Summary
We analyzed the four critical issues in the Virtual Signal Architecture and identified targeted root causes and fixes to restore correct operation and expected performance. Specifically, we found that entry signals are being blocked by conditional logic and market‚Äëhour settings, exit logic is executing out of order and interfering with entries, the virtual backtester‚Äôs table isn‚Äôt synchronizing with strategy logic or input changes, and missing defensive checks are causing runtime errors and performance issues. Our action plan isolates each problem, applies systematic debugging and refactoring, and adds safeguards‚Äîensuring the strategy generates the intended trade frequency, maintains entry/exit independence, accurately reports virtual metrics, and runs stably.

Issue¬†#1: Catastrophic Trade Frequency Discrepancy
Root Cause Analysis
Entry Blocking Logic: Conditional checks (e.g., strategy.position_size == 0) may never evaluate true when combined with other hidden flags, preventing strategy.entry() from firing

.

Market‚ÄëHour Filters: Signals occurring outside regular trading hours or on weekends are ignored by the broker emulator, leading to zero entries .

Invalid Position Size: positionQty may inadvertently be set to zero (due to bad inputs or reset logic), so entries are silently skipped

Action Plan
Comprehensive Entry Logging: Wrap every strategy.entry() call in if debugEnabled blocks that label.new the value of all entry‚Äërelevant flags (signal booleans, strategy.position_size, positionQty) to pinpoint failures

Enforce Trading Sessions: Use Pine Script‚Äôs time(timeframe.period, ‚Äú0930-1600‚Äù, ‚ÄúGMT-5‚Äù) or session.isregular to block signals strictly to market hours and exclude weekends .

Issue¬†#2: Exit System Dependency Problem
Root Cause Analysis
Execution Order Flaw: Exit checks (strategy.exit/strategy.close) may run before the entry logic in the script, cancelling positions immediately or resetting flags that block entries

Bar‚ÄëClose Timing: Exits tied to bar‚Äëclose events (calc_on_every_tick = false) may fire on the same bar as entry, leaving no flat state for the next entry

Action Plan
Reorder Script Blocks: Move all exit logic blocks below the entry logic section, ensuring entries are evaluated first on each bar

Issue¬†#3: Virtual Table Data Integrity Issues
Root Cause Analysis
Logic Mismatch: The virtual account functions (processVirtualTrade) are not perfectly mirrored to the strategy‚Äôs entry/exit logic, so they ‚Äúsee‚Äù 900 signals while the strategy executes only 95 .

Long/Short Misclassification: Directional flags in virtual accounts may be overwritten or never cleared, causing all trades to appear under ‚ÄúLong‚Äù .

Stale Table State: The table is created once and never cleared or reinitialized when parameters change, so old values persist across input updates 
TradingView
.

Action Plan
Synchronize Logic: Refactor processVirtualTrade and processVirtualExit to call the same signal booleans and entry/exit conditions used by the strategy, ideally by passing the final longEntrySignal/shortEntrySignal directly .

Direction Audit: Add debug labels within each virtual-account function to log account.direction transitions and ensure longs/shorts are counted correctly .

Table Reset Mechanism: Introduce a parametersChanged flag and, when true on barstate.islast, call table.clear() and rebuild the table headers to ensure fresh data on every input change

.

Conditional Rendering: Only show the table when showBacktestTable is true and on the final bar to avoid partially filled rows during live plotting

Issue¬†#4: Runtime Errors & Stability
Root Cause Analysis
Division by Zero: Calculations like profitFactor = grossProfit / grossLoss and drawdown formulas lack guards against grossLoss == 0 or totalTrades == 0, causing runtime exceptions

Action Plan
Defensive Checks: Before any division, wrap calculations in if denominator != 0 and default to zero or na when invalid

Implementation Timeline
Week¬†1 (Entry Debugging): Implement Issue¬†#1 logging and session filters; verify trade counts.

Week¬†2 (Exit Refactor): Restructure exit logic per Issue¬†#2 and run entry/exit independence tests.

Week¬†3 (Virtual Sync): Align virtual-account functions and rebuild the table on parameter changes.

Week¬†4 (Stability Harden): Add defensive guards, safe array logic, and limit visual objects; conduct stress tests.

Following this phased roadmap will systematically resolve each critical flaw while preserving the modular Virtual Signal Architecture framework.
Of course. Here is a detailed root cause analysis and a concrete plan of action to resolve the critical issues in your Virtual Signal Architecture script.

The critical issues in your Pine Script stem from three core problems: conflicting exit systems causing trade suppression, a logic mismatch between the virtual and real strategy, and unprotected calculations leading to runtime errors. The exit system architecture is the most severe flaw, where multiple independent strategy.exit() and strategy.close() calls compete, creating an unstable state that prevents new entries.

üö® Root Cause Analysis
ISSUE #1 & #2: Trade Frequency Discrepancy & Exit System Dependency
Root Cause: Conflicting and Unmanaged Exit Logic.
Your script does not have a unified exit system. Instead, multiple, independent code blocks attempt to manage the strategy's position simultaneously.

Smart Profit Locker (SPL): The strategy.exit() for the SPL is placed on every bar that a position is open. This command to create a trailing stop persists and can interfere with other exit or entry commands on subsequent bars.

MA Exit: A separate if block calls strategy.close() based on MA conditions.

Fixed SL/TP: Another block calls strategy.exit() with stop/limit levels.

Trend Change Exits (Basic & Advanced): Two more blocks call strategy.close() for trend-based reasons.

This creates a "race condition" where multiple, conflicting exit orders are managed by the Pine Script engine. The massive trade increase when SPL is turned off is the key evidence: the persistent strategy.exit() call from the SPL is the primary source of interference that prevents the strategy.position_size == 0 condition from being met cleanly for the next entry signal. The system isn't exiting and becoming "flat" in a way that allows the next entry to fire immediately.

ISSUE #3: Virtual Table Data Integrity Issues
Root Cause: Logic Mismatch Between Virtual and Strategy Execution.
The discrepancy between the ~900 virtual trades and the 95 strategy trades is not a bug in the virtual table itself, but a feature of its current implementation.

Virtual Trade Logic: The processVirtualTrade function executes a trade based only on the raw signal (e.g., sig1Long).

Pine Script

// Virtual Entry Condition
if not account.inPosition
    if longSignal // Only checks the raw signal
Strategy Trade Logic: The actual strategy entry requires the raw signal AND two additional filters to be true.

Pine Script

// Real Strategy Entry Condition
longEntrySignal := primaryLongSig and longDirectionalBias and bbLongFilterOK
if longEntrySignal and strategy.position_size == 0
The virtual system is correctly tracking every raw signal it receives, while the strategy is correctly filtering them. The table is showing you the performance of the raw, unfiltered signals.

Sub-Issue: Long/Short Classification.
The virtual system uses the opposite signal to exit (e.g., a short signal exits a long position). While logical, this can be fragile. If both a long and short signal appear on the same bar for the same indicator, the order of operations in your code (processVirtualTrade then processVirtualExit) can lead to an immediate entry and exit on the same bar, potentially skewing results. The primary issue remains the logic mismatch, but this exit methodology contributes to potential inaccuracies.

ISSUE #4: Runtime Errors & Stability
Root Cause: Unprotected Mathematical Calculations.
The intermittent runtime errors, especially when changing settings, are caused by calculations that do not account for edge cases like zero or na (Not a Number) values.

Division by Zero (Volatility): The volatilityRatio calculation in the Master Panel is the most likely culprit.

Pine Script

atrAvg = ta.sma(atrVal, 20)
volatilityRatio := atrCurrent / atrAvg // Fails if atrAvg is 0 or na
On the first several bars of the chart, atrAvg will be na, causing a runtime error.

Division by Zero (Analytics): The profitFactor calculation in the virtual table is also vulnerable, though it has some protection.

Pine Script

profitFactor = account.grossLoss > 0 ? account.grossProfit / account.grossLoss : ...
If grossLoss is 0 but grossProfit is also 0, the result can be problematic depending on the chain of logic.

üéØ Priority Action Plan
This plan systematically resolves each issue, starting with stabilization and moving to a complete architectural refactor of the exit logic.

PHASE 1: Emergency Stabilization & Validation (Immediate)
This phase aims to get the script into a testable state and validate the core entry logic.

Isolate Entry Logic: Comment out ALL strategy.exit() and strategy.close() calls in the entire script. This disables every conflicting exit system.

Implement a Temporary, Clean Exit: Add a simple, temporary exit at the end of the script to make it testable. This ensures there is only one exit instruction.

Pine Script

// ADD THIS TEMPORARY CODE AT THE END OF THE SCRIPT FOR TESTING
if strategy.position_size > 0 and shortEntrySignal
    strategy.close("Long", comment="Temp Exit")
if strategy.position_size < 0 and longEntrySignal
    strategy.close("Short", comment="Temp Exit")
Goal: Verify that with all exit noise removed, the strategy generates the expected 30-40 trades per day. This confirms the longEntrySignal and shortEntrySignal variables are working correctly.

Fix Runtime Errors: Add defensive checks to all division calculations.

Volatility Ratio:

Pine Script

// FIX for volatilityRatio
volatilityRatio := not na(atrAvg) and atrAvg > 0 ? atrVal / atrAvg : 0
Profit Factor:

Pine Script

// FIX for profitFactor
profitFactor = account.grossLoss > 0 ? account.grossProfit / account.grossLoss : (account.grossProfit > 0 ? 999 : 0)
Sync Virtual & Strategy Logic: Make the virtual backtester obey the same rules as the strategy.

In the processVirtualTrade function, add the same filter conditions used by the main strategy.

Pine Script

// In processVirtualTrade function
// Pass bbLongFilterOK, bbShortFilterOK, longDirectionalBias, shortDirectionalBias into the function
processVirtualTrade(..., bool bbLongOK, bool bbShortOK, bool longBias, bool shortBias) =>
    // ...
    if not account.inPosition
        if longSignal and bbLongOK and longBias // ADDED FILTERS
            // entry logic
        else if shortSignal and bbShortOK and shortBias // ADDED FILTERS
            // entry logic
Goal: The trade count in the Virtual Table should now closely match the strategy backtester's trade count.

PHASE 2: Exit System Refactoring (High Priority)
This is the most critical phase. It rebuilds the exit logic into a stable, non-conflicting architecture.

Design a Master Exit Controller: Instead of scattered strategy.close() calls, create a single, unified system. At the start of your main execution logic, declare boolean variables for each exit reason.

Pine Script

// Declare exit reason flags at the top of the execution block
var bool exitSignalTriggered = false
var string exitReason = ""

exitSignalTriggered := false // Reset on every bar
exitReason := ""
Calculate Exit Conditions: Go through your existing exit logic (MA, Trend Change, etc.) but instead of calling strategy.close(), just set the flag.

Pine Script

// MA Exit LOGIC (MODIFIED)
if maExitOn and strategy.position_size != 0
    if (strategy.position_size > 0 and close < priceMA) or (strategy.position_size < 0 and close > priceMA)
        exitSignalTriggered := true
        exitReason := "MA Exit"

// TREND CHANGE EXIT LOGIC (MODIFIED)
if colorChangeExit and not exitSignalTriggered // Check if another signal already triggered
    exitSignalTriggered := true
    exitReason := "LRC Exit"

// ... do this for all other manual close conditions, using else if or checking 'not exitSignalTriggered' to create a priority system.
Execute a Single, Unified Exit: At the very end of the script, have one block that executes the exit based on the master flag.

Pine Script

// MASTER EXIT EXECUTION BLOCK (replaces all other strategy.close calls)
if exitSignalTriggered and strategy.position_size != 0
    strategy.close(strategy.position_id, comment = exitReason)
Integrate strategy.exit(): The strategy.exit() calls (for SPL and Fixed SL/TP) work differently as they manage orders, not immediate closes. Ensure they are only placed once when a trade is entered, not on every bar.

Pine Script

// In the main ENTRY LOGIC block
if longEntrySignal and strategy.position_size == 0
    strategy.entry("Long", ...)
    // Place strategy.exit() orders ONLY ONCE at entry
    if smartProfitEnable
        strategy.exit('Smart-Long', from_entry='Long', trail_points=..., trail_offset=...)
    if fixedEnable
        strategy.exit("Fixed-Long", from_entry="Long", stop=..., limit=...)
Goal: The strategy now has a clean, predictable exit priority. Changing exit systems will no longer break trade frequency.

PHASE 3: Data Integrity and Final Validation
This phase cleans up the remaining data issues and validates the final system.

Audit Virtual Account Exits: Replace the fragile "opposite signal" exit logic in the virtual accounts with a more robust system that mirrors the main strategy's new Master Exit Controller for more accurate P/L attribution.

Validate Analytics: With the system now stable, run several backtests. Confirm that the strategy backtester and the (now-synced) virtual table report metrics within a 5% tolerance of each other.

Performance Optimization: Ensure all table drawing and heavy calculations inside panels are wrapped in if barstate.islast blocks to prevent them from running on every bar tick, which will improve script performance and stability.
We'll focus on Phase 1 and then proceed to Phase 2.
Let's code accordingly.
üö® ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS & ACTION PLAN
CORE ISSUE SUMMARY
The primary failure stems from exit systems interfering with entry logic, specifically:

Exit conditions are evaluated before entries in execution order

Exit systems modify entry signal variables (longEntrySignal, shortEntrySignal)

Position state checks (strategy.position_size == 0) block valid entries

Virtual accounts don't mirror strategy entry conditions

üîß PHASE 1: EMERGENCY STABILIZATION (IMMEDIATE)
1. ISOLATE ENTRY LOGIC
pinescript
// BEFORE (problematic)
if (longEntrySignal and strategy.position_size == 0)
    strategy.entry(...)

// AFTER (fixed)
entryAllowed = strategy.position_size == 0 or reEntrySignal
if (longEntrySignal and entryAllowed)
    strategy.entry(...)
2. DEBUG ENTRY BLOCKING
Add comprehensive logging:

pinescript
// Add to entry logic
debugEntry() =>
    if longEntrySignal and not entryAllowed
        debugMessage("BLOCK", "Long blocked. Position: " + 
            str.tostring(strategy.position_size) + 
            " ReEntry: " + str.tostring(reEntrySignal), 
            color.red, color.white, 0.25)
3. FIX RUNTIME ERRORS
pinescript
// BEFORE (crash-prone)
profitFactor = account.grossProfit / account.grossLoss

// AFTER (fixed)
profitFactor = account.grossLoss > 0 ? 
    account.grossProfit / account.grossLoss : 
    account.grossProfit > 0 ? 999 : 0
4. SYNC VIRTUAL & STRATEGY LOGIC
pinescript
// Modify virtual account processing
processVirtualTrade(..., bool useStrategyConditions) =>
    if useStrategyConditions
        validLong = longSignal and longDirectionalBias and bbLongFilterOK
        validShort = shortSignal and shortDirectionalBias and bbShortFilterOK
    else
        validLong = longSignal
        validShort = shortSignal
    // ... rest of logic
‚öôÔ∏è PHASE 2: EXIT SYSTEM RECONSTRUCTION (HIGH PRIORITY)
1. AUDIT EXECUTION ORDER
Correct Flow:

text
1. Entry Signal Generation
2. Position State Checks
3. Entry Execution
4. Exit Signal Generation
5. Exit Execution
2. ENSURE VARIABLE ISOLATION
pinescript
// BEFORE (dangerous)
if exitCondition
    longEntrySignal := false  // KILLS ENTRIES!

// AFTER (safe)
exitLong = exitCondition and strategy.position_size > 0
if exitLong
    strategy.close(...)
3. EXIT CONDITION GUARDS
pinescript
// Add to all exit systems
shouldExit = strategy.position_size != 0 and not na(strategy.position_avg_price)
if shouldExit and yourExitCondition
    strategy.close(...)
4. HYBRID EXIT DECOUPLING
pinescript
// Fix hybrid switching logic
hybridUsingSPL := currentPositionSize < hybridSwitchThreshold
hybridUsingTCE := currentPositionSize >= hybridSwitchThreshold
üìä PHASE 3: DATA INTEGRITY RESTORATION
1. CORRECT LONG/SHORT CLASSIFICATION
pinescript
// In virtual account processing
if account.direction == "long"
    account.longPnL += finalPnL
    account.longTrades += 1
    if finalPnL > 0
        account.longWins += 1
// Repeat for shorts
2. ENHANCE PARAMETER DETECTION
pinescript
// Add to hash calculation
calculateParameterHash() =>
    hash = ...
    hash += str.hash(str.tostring(maExitOn))
    hash += str.hash(str.tostring(smartProfitEnable))
    // Add ALL critical parameters
3. OPTIMIZE TABLE UPDATES
pinescript
// Only update on last bar
if barstate.islast and showBacktestTable
    // Table rendering logic
4. VALIDATION PROTOCOL
