## 🔍 CRITICAL BUGS IDENTIFIED

### 1. HIGH-IMPACT FIXES (Immediate Action Required)

#### Bug 1.1: Signal Validation Logic Flaw ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Location**: Signal processing functions  
**Issue**: `isValidSignalSource()` function incorrectly blocks valid indicators  
**Problem**: The check `src != close` blocks legitimate indicators when their value equals close  
**Impact**: Valid signals are blocked, reducing strategy effectiveness  
**Fix Priority**: IMMEDIATE

```pinescript
// CURRENT (Problematic):
isValidSignalSource(src) =>
    not na(src) and src != close and src != open and src != high and src != low

// RECOMMENDED FIX:
isValidSignalSource(src) =>
    not na(src) and not (src == close and src == open and src == high and src == low)
```

#### Bug 1.2: Entry Signal Assignment Timing ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Location**: Final entry logic section  
**Issue**: Entry signals assigned after `strategy.entry()` calls  
**Problem**: May use previous bar's values for current bar's trades  
**Impact**: Incorrect trade timing and entry conditions  
**Fix Priority**: IMMEDIATE

#### Bug 1.3: Exit Flag Reset Logic ⚠️ HIGH
**Location**: Exit control flags section  
**Issue**: Exit flags may not reset properly in rapid position changes  
**Problem**: Could cause missed exits or duplicate exit attempts  
**Impact**: Risk management failures  
**Fix Priority**: HIGH

### 2. MEDIUM-IMPACT FIXES (Next Sprint)

#### Bug 2.1: Boolean Conversion Logic
**Location**: Signal detection lines  
**Issue**: Redundant boolean conversions  
**Problem**: `bool(signal1LongSrc) == true` is redundant and may cause issues  
**Impact**: Potential logic errors and performance degradation  

#### Bug 2.2: Weighted Voting Math Precision
**Location**: Confluence logic section  
**Issue**: Mixed integer and float weights could cause rounding errors  
**Problem**: Decimal weighting system precision issues  
**Impact**: Incorrect filter confluence calculations  

#### Bug 2.3: Trend-Riding Variable Initialization
**Location**: Global variables section  
**Issue**: Some trend-riding variables persist across strategy resets  
**Problem**: Variables declared with `var` don't reset on new backtests  
**Impact**: Incorrect trend-riding behavior in backtesting  

### 3. LOW-IMPACT OPTIMIZATIONS (Future Improvements)

#### Bug 3.1: Debug System Performance
**Location**: Throughout script  
**Issue**: Excessive debug logging could impact performance  
**Impact**: Slower execution when debug enabled  

#### Bug 3.2: Memory Management
**Location**: Various calculation arrays  
**Issue**: Some arrays may not be properly managed  
**Impact**: Potential memory usage issues
