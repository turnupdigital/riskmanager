Below is a sober “logic-trace” of the exact build you pasted.
I walk the code in the same order Pine does, flip the bits in plain English, and show which statement prevents the first contract from ever being opened.
That lets us decide which of the two candidate bugs is the blocking one and which is only a follow-on problem.

1 ️⃣ Signal path – why every sigXLong/Short is false
Pipe-line stage	Code fragment	Value produced on a live bar
GUI choice	signal1Usage = "All Entries"
signal2Usage = "All Entries"	–
Filter	pinescript<br>fUsageAllowed(entrySide, usage) =><br> isEntry = str.contains(usage,"Entry") // false – “Entries” ≠ “Entry”<br> isExit = str.contains(usage,"Exit") // false<br> …<br> (isEntry or isExit) // ⟵ **false**<br>	always false
Apply filter	sig1Long := fUsageAllowed("LONG",signal1Usage) and …	therefore false
Aggregation	primaryLongSig = array_any(allLongSignals)	array is all false → false
Final gate	longEntrySignal := … sigCountLong>0 …	count = 0 → false
Trade engine	pinescript<br>if longEntrySignal and strategy.position_size < pyramidLimit<br> strategy.entry("Long", …)	never executed

🔑 Conclusion: As long as the dropdowns contain

sql
Copy
Edit
Long Only | Short Only | All Entries | Observe
the substring test str.contains(usage,"Entry") never sees "Entry" (the missing y), so no signal survives the very first Boolean AND.
That alone is sufficient to explain “strategy never trades”.

2 ️⃣ Trend-exit mix-up – what happens after you let a trade in
You also spotted this inversion:

pinescript
Copy
Edit
if strategy.position_size > 0 and exitShortPulse  // ← should be exitLongPulse
    strategy.close("Long", …)
True: the moment a long signal fires it lands in both exitShortPulse and (via other paths) the entry logic; with calc_on_order_fills = true the position would be closed on the same tick — you would see ❶ an entry in the “Strategy Tester / List of Trades” with a 0-bar duration and ❷ a net P/L of zero (minus fees).

But you would still see trades (brief ones) and arrows on the chart. Because you see none right now, the exit inversion cannot be the blocking culprit — it only bites after a position is opened, which never happens due to the usage filter.

3 ️⃣ Quick litmus test (copy-paste ready)
Put this mini snippet anywhere below the function definition:

pinescript
Copy
Edit
//@debug quick check
if barstate.islast
    var string[] choices = array.from("Long Only","Short Only","All Entries","Observe")
    for i=0 to array.size(choices)-1
        u = array.get(choices,i)
        label.new(bar_index + i, high,
          u + "  ➜  " + str.tostring(fUsageAllowed("LONG",u)))
All four labels print ➜ false.
Change "All Entries" → "All Entry" (or just "All Entry signals" etc.) and the corresponding label flips to true and the strategy begins to take trades instantly — proof that the usage filter is the gating fault.

4 ️⃣ Fix hierarchy
Stop the total blockade – either

change the GUI strings to contain “Entry”/“Exit”, or

rewrite fUsageAllowed() to test for the exact menu items:

pinescript
Copy
Edit
fUsageAllowed(side, usage) =>
    usage == "All Entries" ? true :
    usage == "Long Only"   ? side=="LONG" :
    usage == "Short Only"  ? side=="SHORT" :
    false   // Observe
Then swap the two exit pulses so the trade is not auto-closed:

pinescript
Copy
Edit
if strategy.position_size > 0 and exitLongPulse   // correct variable
if strategy.position_size < 0 and exitShortPulse  // correct variable
Do (1) and you’ll start seeing positions; do (2) and they will actually last.
That matches the symptoms and the control-flow proof above.

Thought for 1m 0s
🚑 Root-cause: all 10 signals are being blanked out by fUsageAllowed() before they ever reach the strategy.entry() call
What the code does	Why it blocks every signal out-of-the-box
```pinescript	
fUsageAllowed(entrySide, usage) =>

isEntry = str.contains(usage, "Entry")
isExit  = str.contains(usage, "Exit")
isAll   = str.contains(usage, "All")
isLong  = str.contains(usage, "Long")
isShort = str.contains(usage, "Short")

(isEntry or isExit) and (isAll or (isLong and entrySide=="LONG") or (isShort and entrySide=="SHORT"))
```|* The first AND-clause requires isEntry or isExit to be true.<br> * Yet the UI strings you pipe into the function are: <br>  "Long Only" "Short Only" "All Entries" "Observe"<br> * None of them contain the literal substring “Entry” (note the missing y in “Entries”) or “Exit”. <br> * Therefore isEntry==false and isExit==false → the whole expression returns false, so every sigXLong/Short is immediately zeroed out. |

How to prove it yourself in 10 seconds
Open the Pine console and run:

pinescript
Copy
Edit
// paste inside your script temporarily
var string[] test = array.from("Long Only","Short Only","All Entries","Observe")
for i=0 to array.size(test)-1
    usage = array.get(test,i)
    label.new(bar_index, high, usage + " -> " + str.tostring(fUsageAllowed("LONG", usage)))
Every label prints … -> false. As a consequence:

sig1Long … sig10Short are all false

allLongSignals / allShortSignals arrays fill with false

primaryLongSig, sigCountLong, longEntrySignal etc. never turn on

Strategy remains flat forever ➜ “strategy is not taking trades”.

🔧 Two quick fixes
Good for…	Patch
Minimal change (keep current UI wording)	Replace the first line inside fUsageAllowed() with a check on the whole string:
```pinescript
validEntry = usage == "Long Only" or usage == "Short Only" or usage == "All Entries"	
validExit = usage == "Exit Only" // if you ever add this	
(isAll or validEntry) and …```	
Cleaner long-term	Change the dropdown values to exactly “Long Entry”, “Short Entry”, “All Entries”, “Observe”. Then the existing str.contains(usage,"Entry") test works and you can drop the edge-case logic.

Do that, re-compile, and you’ll immediately see arrows and filled positions without touching any other block (pyramiding, filters, SPL, etc.).

🔍 Why nothing else is the culprit
entryAllowed defaults to true, and the pyramid cap isn’t reached because you never open the first contract.

BB/RBW filters default to false, so they are not gating entries.

The giant hybrid / phantom / SPL sections execute after the signal test—if no signal survives, they’re never invoked.

Fix the usage filter and the rest of the engine springs to life.


Based on my analysis of the code and project knowledge, I've identified the root cause of why the strategy is not taking trades. Here's my comprehensive root cause analysis:
🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: Strategy Not Taking Trades
Primary Issues Blocking Trade Execution:
1. CRITICAL: Signal Detection Logic Flawed ⚠️
Location: Lines 632-641 in the script
Problem: The signal detection logic has two critical flaws:
pinescript// Current problematic logic:
sig1Long = signal1Enable ? (signal1LongSrc != close ? (signal1LongSrc > 0 or bool(signal1LongSrc) == true) : close > close[1]) : false
Issues:

Default Signal Generation: When signal1LongSrc == close (default), it generates signals on close > close[1] - meaning it fires on EVERY green candle
Boolean Casting Problem: bool(signal1LongSrc) treats ANY non-zero value as true, creating false signals
No Proper External Indicator Detection: The logic doesn't properly distinguish between connected external indicators and default close values

2. Filter System Blocking All Trades 🚫
Location: Lines 869-873
Problem: Multiple filters are likely blocking trades:
pinescriptlongEntrySignal := sigCountLong > 0 and (longFiltersPassed or not rbwEnable or not bbEntryFilterEnable)
Potential Blockers:

RBW Filter: May be permanently blocking trades if rbwEnable = true but longDirectionalBias = false
Bollinger Band Filter: Could be blocking entries if price is outside BB extremes
Filter Bypass Logic: The bypass logic may not be working correctly

3. Entry Permission System Issue 🔒
Location: Lines 1858-1862
Problem: The entryAllowed flag system:
pinescriptentryAllowed := currentPositionSize < pyramidLimit
Issues:

May be stuck in false state due to phantom position detection
Could be incorrectly calculated due to currentPositionSize tracking issues

4. Signal Processing Chain Broken ⛓️
Location: Multiple locations (Lines 632-748)
Problem: The signal processing chain has multiple points of failure:

Raw signal detection (flawed)
Usage filter application (may be too restrictive)
Only Mode processing (could silence all signals)
Final signal aggregation (may not properly combine signals)


🔧 IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSTIC STEPS:
Step 1: Enable Debug Mode
Set these inputs to true:

🔍 Enable Debug Labels
Show Entry Blocks
🧪 Enable Testing Mode

Step 2: Check Signal Configuration
Verify in the 2️⃣ Entry Signals section:

At least one signal is enabled (Signal 1 Enable = true)
Signal sources are properly connected to external indicators
Usage is set to 'All Entries' not 'Observe'

Step 3: Disable All Filters Temporarily
Set these to false to bypass filters:

Enable RBW Filter = false
BB Entry Filter = false
🧪 Test Mode Override = true (if available)

Step 4: Check for Signal Activity
Look for these debug messages on the chart:

"ENTRY DEBUG:" labels showing signal counts
"TRADE_EXEC:" messages showing filter status
"🚫 STRATEGY BLOCKED:" warnings


🛠️ RECOMMENDED FIXES (In Priority Order):
Fix 1: Correct Signal Detection Logic (CRITICAL)
Replace the flawed signal detection with proper logic:
pinescript// Fix for proper external indicator detection
sig1Long = signal1Enable ? 
    (signal1LongSrc != close ? 
        ta.change(signal1LongSrc) > 0 :  // External indicator: detect positive changes
        false) :  // Don't generate default signals when source = close
    false
Fix 2: Add Filter Bypass for Testing
Ensure filters can be bypassed:
pinescript// Add this input if not present:
testModeOverride = input.bool(false, "🧪 Test Mode Override", group="Debug")

// Update entry logic:
longEntrySignal := sigCountLong > 0 and (testModeOverride or (longFiltersPassed or not rbwEnable))
Fix 3: Fix Entry Permission Logic
Ensure entryAllowed works correctly:
pinescript// Add proper reset logic:
if strategy.position_size == 0
    entryAllowed := true
else
    entryAllowed := currentPositionSize < pyramidLimit
Fix 4: Add Comprehensive Debug Output
Add debug labels to show exactly what's happening:
pinescriptif debugEnabled and (primaryLongSig or primaryShortSig)
    debugText = "SIGNAL STATUS:\n"
    debugText += "Long Signals: " + str.tostring(sigCountLong) + "\n"
    debugText += "Short Signals: " + str.tostring(sigCountShort) + "\n"
    debugText += "Entry Allowed: " + str.tostring(entryAllowed) + "\n"
    debugText += "RBW Bias Long: " + str.tostring(longDirectionalBias) + "\n"
    debugText += "BB Filter OK: " + str.tostring(bbLongFilterOK)
    
    label.new(bar_index, high, debugText, style=label.style_label_down, 
              color=color.blue, textcolor=color.white, size=size.normal)

🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN:

Enable debug mode and look for diagnostic messages
Temporarily disable all filters to isolate the signal detection issue
Verify at least one signal is properly enabled and connected
Check for "🚫 BLOCKED" labels that show why entries are being rejected
Apply the signal detection logic fix as the primary solution

The most likely culprit is the flawed signal detection logic that either generates false signals or fails to detect real external indicator signals properly. The secondary issue is the filter system potentially blocking all legitimate trades.

Of course. After a thorough analysis, the root cause of the strategy not taking trades is a logical error in the trend mode exit system. Specifically, the condition to exit a trade is the same as the condition that entered it, causing any new position to be closed instantly.

Here's a detailed root cause analysis and the required fix.

Root Cause Analysis
The script is designed to switch from "SCALP" mode to "TREND" mode based on signal strength. However, when it promotes a trade to "TREND" mode, the exit logic immediately closes the position.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the failure:

Entry Signal: A long entry is triggered when a signal like sig1Long becomes true. With default settings, this happens on any green candle (close > close[1]).

Promotion to Trend Mode: On the same bar the entry occurs, the script evaluates the conditions to promote the trade to "TREND" mode. Since the signal is active, the "Signal Power" threshold is met, and the tradeMode variable flips from "SCALP" to "TREND".

Flawed Exit Logic: The script then checks the exit logic for trend mode (around line 2901):

Pine Script

// This is the incorrect logic in your script
if strategy.position_size > 0 and exitShortPulse // Corrected from exitLongPulse to exitShortPulse for long exits
    strategy.close("Long", comment="Trend Exit: Opposite Signal", alert_message=longExitMsg)
The Contradiction:

The variable exitShortPulse is an aggregation of all long entry signals (the naming is confusing).

Therefore, the code reads: "If we are in a long position AND the long entry signal is active, close the long position."

Since the strategy just entered because the long signal was active, this condition is immediately true.

Instant Exit: Because calc_on_order_fills = true is set in the strategy declaration, the script recalculates the moment the entry order is filled. The flawed exit logic runs and closes the trade on the very same tick it was opened. From the chart, it appears as though no trade was ever taken.

The revealing comment, // Corrected from exitLongPulse to exitShortPulse for long exits, indicates that a previous change introduced this bug. The logic was likely correct before this "correction."

How to Fix the Strategy
You need to reverse the exit logic so that long positions are closed by short signals, and short positions are closed by long signals.

Corrected Code
Replace the "HYBRID TREND MODE EXIT LOGIC" section starting around line 2894 with this corrected version:

Pine Script

// ═══════════════════ HYBRID TREND MODE EXIT LOGIC (FIXED) ═══════════════════
// Core trend following system: Exit on ANY opposite signal when in TREND or HYBRID mode
if (tradeMode == "TREND" or tradeMode == "HYBRID") and strategy.position_size != 0
{
    // FIX: To exit a LONG position, we must check for a SHORT signal pulse (exitLongPulse).
    if (strategy.position_size > 0 and exitLongPulse)
    {
        strategy.close("Long", comment="Trend Exit: Opposite Signal", alert_message=longExitMsg);
        entryAllowed := true; // Re-enable entries after exit
        
        // --- TREND EXIT BADGE DISPLAY ---
        if (shouldRenderCritical)
        {
            exitLabelId = getLabelFromPool(true);
            if (not na(exitLabelId))
            {
                exitYPos = high + (atrVal * 0.7);
                updateLabel(exitLabelId, bar_index, exitYPos, "TREND EXIT", label.style_label_down, color.new(color.purple, 20), color.white, size.small);
            }
        }
    }

    // FIX: To exit a SHORT position, we must check for a LONG signal pulse (exitShortPulse).
    if (strategy.position_size < 0 and exitShortPulse)
    {
        strategy.close("Short", comment="Trend Exit: Opposite Signal", alert_message=shortExitMsg);
        entryAllowed := true; // Re-enable entries after exit

        // --- TREND EXIT BADGE DISPLAY ---
        if (shouldRenderCritical)
        {
            exitLabelId = getLabelFromPool(true);
            if (not na(exitLabelId))
            {
                exitYPos = low - (atrVal * 0.7);
                updateLabel(exitLabelId, bar_index, exitYPos, "TREND EXIT", label.style_label_up, color.new(color.purple, 20), color.white, size.small);
            }
        }
    }
}
Explanation of the Fix
exitLongPulse: This variable correctly aggregates all short signals and is used to exit long positions.

exitShortPulse: This variable correctly aggregates all long signals and is used to exit short positions.

By swapping the variables back to their correct purposes, the strategy will now hold trades in trend mode until an actual opposite signal appears, allowing it to function as intended.

Secondary Issue: Default Signal Logic
Once you apply the fix, you'll notice the strategy starts trading very frequently. This is because the default signal source is close, and the logic to trigger a signal is simply close > close[1] (a green candle).

This is not a sustainable strategy and will result in over-trading. You should connect the signal sources (signal1LongSrc, signal1ShortSrc, etc.) to the plots of actual indicators (like LuxAlgo, UT Bot, etc.) as intended by the script's design.
