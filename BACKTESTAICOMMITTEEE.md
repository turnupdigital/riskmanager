Below is an in‑depth look at how you might architect a Pine Script–based “Virtual Backtest Library,” along with best practices, pitfalls to avoid, and alternative approaches. Key takeaways are summarized up front.

Summary of Key Recommendations

Use a formal Pine Script library (library.new()) with exported functions and UDTs to encapsulate virtual accounts, since libraries isolate state and avoid polluting your main strategy’s execution

1. Pine Script Library Architecture
1.1 Using library.new() vs. Pure Functions
Pine Script v5 introduced first‑class libraries. Libraries let you encapsulate UDTs and functions, keeping your main strategy script lean. You use:

pinescript
Copy
Edit
// In library file
//@version=5
library("VirtualBacktestLib")
@export VirtualManager init(string[] names, int settings) => …
@export void process(VirtualManager vm, bool[] longSig, bool[] shortSig, float price) => …
@export void render(VirtualManager vm, table tbl) => …
Then in your strategy:

pinescript
Copy
Edit
import VirtualBacktestLib as VBT
vm = VBT.init(signalNames, settings)
VBT.process(vm, allLong, allShort, close)
VBT.render(vm, myTable)
This isolates your virtual‐account code from the main script’s state

.

1.2 Library Limitations and Constraints
No input.* in libraries; all configuration must be passed as function args 
TradingView
.

Global variables are allowed (for persistent state) but must be declared outside any function and only modified within exported functions 
TradingView
.

Size limits: Libraries count toward the same script‑size limits (≈2,000 lines and ~100 kB) 
Scribd
.

Exported functions incur minimal overhead but avoid deeply nested calls; keep interfaces shallow 
TradingView
.

2. Data Management
2.1 Persistent State Across Bars
Use global arrays or UDT fields to store each virtual account’s:

bool inPosition

float entryPrice, currentPnL, totalPnL

int totalTrades, winTrades

float maxDrawdown
You reset all accounts by detecting parameter changes via a hash of inputs (commission, slippage, signal enables). When the hash differs, call a reset() function in the library 
Scribd
.

2.2 Handling Pine Script Limits
Pine imposes hard limits on:

Array length (~16 000 elements across all arrays)

Execution time per bar (≈200 ms)

Global variable count (~200)
Favor fixed‑size arrays of length 10 for signals, and avoid accumulating massive historical buffers in‑script 
QuantNomad
.

3. Signal Processing
3.1 Ordering and Synchronization
Call process() after computing your main strategy’s entry/exits to mirror real trades exactly. Pass the same filtered signals (long + direction bias + BB filters) to virtual accounts so they “see” identical conditions 
TradingView
.

3.2 Efficient Looping
Instead of 10 separate function calls, accept bool[] longSig, bool[] shortSig and loop inside the library:

pinescript
Copy
Edit
for i = 0 to array.size(longSig)-1
    if longSig[i]
        // entry logic
    if shortSig[i]
        // exit logic
This reduces overhead compared to 10 independent calls 
Stack Overflow
.

4. Performance Optimization
4.1 Minimize Computation
Precompute any heavy indicators (ATR, MA) once per bar, not per signal.

Use built‑ins (ta.sma, ta.atr, array ops) instead of custom loops where possible 
Medium
.

4.2 Batch vs. Individual Processing
Batch‑processing signals in one loop is faster than multiple function calls 
Stack Overflow
. Where possible, process virtual trades after bar close (if barstate.isconfirmed) to skip intrabar overhead.

5. Error Handling & Debugging
5.1 Logging in Libraries
Since libraries can’t use input.*, include a bool debug argument:

pinescript
Copy
Edit
@export void process(VirtualManager vm, bool debug, bool[] longSig, bool[] shortSig, float price) => 
    if debug
        vm.log := array.push(vm.log, "Signal "+str.tostring(i)+" entry") 
Then in your strategy, read vm.log and plot with label.new() 
TradingView
.

5.2 Validating Accuracy
Unit‑test small synthetic series (e.g. alternating long/flat) and compare library results to hand‑calculated benchmarks.

Use table rendering inside the library’s render() to snapshot P&L, win rates, and drawdowns per bar—faster than external scripts 
TradingView
.

6. Pine Script Specifics
6.1 UDTs and Complex Data
User‐Defined Types (UDTs) let you group related fields. Define a VirtualAccount UDT for clean code:

pinescript
Copy
Edit
type VirtualAccount
    bool inPosition
    float entryPrice, totalPnL
    int trades, wins
    float maxDrawdown

YouTube
.

6.2 Library Versioning & Updates
Pine doesn’t support semantic versioning in libraries. Best practice is to include a version constant and check it in init(), resetting state if mismatched 
TradingView
.

7. Alternative Approaches
7.1 Pure-Function Module
If isolation isn’t critical, you can omit library.new() and simply define functions at top of your script:

pinescript
Copy
Edit
fun_process(…) => …  
fun_render(…) => …
This avoids library overhead but mixes code with strategy.

7.2 External Backtesting Tools
For very heavy analytics, consider exporting signals via webhooks and post‑processing in Python or R. This offloads computation off‑chart and sidesteps Pine limits 
TradingView
.

7.3 Hybrid Designs
Split core trade execution and analytics: keep entry/exit minimal in strategy, and call a lightweight analytics module that records signals to a string log or alert, then parse off‑line.

In summary, a formal Pine Script library with a clear three‑function API provides strong isolation, maintainability, and reuse. Be mindful of Pine’s resource constraints by batching operations, using UDTs, and resetting state on parameter changes. For maximum performance, minimize loops, leverage built‑ins, and consider external post‑processing when your analytics outgrow Pine’s on‑chart engine.


Of course. After reviewing your proposal, the committee agrees that abstracting the virtual backtesting logic into a separate, reusable module is the correct architectural path. It directly addresses the core problems of interference and complexity you're facing.

However, a formal Pine Script library is not the right tool for this specific job due to critical limitations in state management. The optimal solution is a Hybrid Module Approach, which combines stateless, reusable functions in a separate file with state management handled by the main strategy. This gives you the clean separation you want without fighting the platform's design.

🤖 AI Committee Recommendations & Analysis
1. Pine Script Library Architecture: Use a Module, Not a Library
A formal library is designed for sharing stateless functions—functions that calculate a result based only on their inputs, like a custom moving average. Your virtual backtester is inherently stateful; it must remember entryPrice, inPosition, and totalPnL across multiple bars.

Why library.new() is the wrong approach:

No Persistent State: Libraries cannot declare var variables in the global scope of the script that imports them. This makes tracking a position across bars extremely difficult and inefficient, requiring you to pass the entire state back and forth on every function call.

Performance Overhead: The workarounds required to manage state in a library would be complex and slow, negating the benefits of separation.

The Recommended Approach: A Pure Function Module

Create a standard Pine Script file (e.g., VirtualBacktester.pine).

Write all your logic inside export functions (e.g., export f_process_trade(...), export f_render_analytics(...)).

In your main strategy, use the import statement to access these functions. This provides the code separation and reusability of a library without the state management limitations.

2. Data Management: The Hybrid Model
The key to success is letting the main strategy "own" the state, while the module handles the calculations.

State Management: The array of your VirtualAccount custom types must be declared using var in your main strategy script. This is the only way to maintain its state across bars.

Pine Script

// In MAIN strategy script
import TradingCode/MyModules/VirtualBacktester/1 as VBT

type VirtualAccount
    // ... fields ...

var array<VirtualAccount> G_virtualAccounts = array.new<VirtualAccount>() 
// Initialize array on first bar
Data Passing: Use a clean "pass-by-reference, return-by-value" pattern. The main script loops through its state array, passes a single account object to the module function, and the function returns the updated object.

Pine Script

// In MAIN strategy script's execution block
for i = 0 to array.size(G_virtualAccounts) - 1
    // Get the current state
    _account = array.get(G_virtualAccounts, i)

    // Pass state to the module for processing
    _updatedAccount = VBT.f_process_trade(_account, _signal_data, close)

    // Update the state array with the returned, modified object
    array.set(G_virtualAccounts, i, _updatedAccount)
Parameter Resets: The logic to detect parameter changes and reset the G_virtualAccounts array must also reside in the main strategy, as it's the owner of the state.

3. Signal Processing: A Passive Subscriber Model
To guarantee no interference, the virtual system must be a passive listener.

Synchronization: The module's processing function should not receive raw signals. It should receive the final, filtered boolean signal that the main strategy has already decided to act upon. This ensures the virtual backtest perfectly mirrors the strategy's conditions.

Execution Order: The module's f_process_trade() function should be called after the main strategy's entry and exit logic for the bar has been fully determined. This ensures it's analyzing the result of the bar's events, not predicting them.

Complex Conditions: Because the module receives a simple true/false signal, it doesn't need to know about the complex filtering. The main strategy handles the complexity; the module simply records the result.

4. Performance Optimization: Separate Calculation from Rendering
Minimize Bar-by-Bar Logic: The f_process_trade() function, which runs on every bar, should be lightweight. It should only update the numbers for the currently active virtual trade.

Isolate Heavy Rendering: All table and label drawing logic should be in a separate function, like f_render_analytics(), and this function must be called from within an if barstate.islast block in the main strategy. This is the single most important performance optimization.

Efficient Data Structures: Using a custom type for your VirtualAccount is the correct and most efficient way to group and pass state data.

5. Error Handling & Debugging: The Test Harness
Debugging an imported module can be tricky.

Create a "Test Harness" Script: Have a separate, simple strategy script whose only purpose is to import your module. In this script, you can call your module's functions with hard-coded data (e.g., f_process_trade(_test_account, true, 105.0)) to test specific scenarios in isolation without the noise of the main strategy.

Pass-Through Debug Flag: Add a boolean parameter to your module's init or process functions (e.g., _debug_mode). The main strategy's input.bool for debugging can be passed through, allowing you to enable/disable log.info or debug plots inside your module code.

💡 Proposed Architecture: A Practical Blueprint
This is the most effective and maintainable architecture for your goal.

VirtualBacktester.pine (Your Module File)
Pine Script

// @version=5
export f_process_trade(ip_account, ip_longSignal, ip_shortSignal, ip_price, ip_settings) =>
    // This is a PURE function. It only knows what it's given.
    // It modifies the ip_account object it received.
    if not ip_account.inPosition and ip_longSignal
        ip_account.inPosition := true
        ip_account.entryPrice := ip_price
        // ... more logic
    
    // ...
    
    // Return the MODIFIED account object
    ip_account 

export f_render_analytics(ip_accounts_array, ip_table) =>
    // This function only draws. It doesn't calculate state.
    for account in ip_accounts_array
        // ... table.cell() logic ...
    // No return value needed
MainStrategy.pine (Your Strategy File)
Pine Script

// @version=5
strategy("My Strategy", ...)

// Import your module
import YourUsername/MyModules/VirtualBacktester/1 as VBT

// Define the state data structure
type VirtualAccount
    bool inPosition = false
    float entryPrice = na
    // ... other fields

// OWN THE STATE in the main script
var array<VirtualAccount> G_virtualAccounts = VBT.f_init_accounts(10)

// --- MAIN STRATEGY LOGIC ---
// ... calculate all your filters and final signals ...
finalLongEntry = sig1Long and longBias and bbFilterOK // Example

// --- VIRTUAL BACKTEST PROCESSING ---
// Loop through your state array
for i = 0 to 9
    // Get current account state
    _account = array.get(G_virtualAccounts, i)
    _signal  = array.get(finalSignalBooleans, i) // Get the FINAL signal for this account

    // Pass state to the module; get the updated state back
    _updatedAccount = VBT.f_process_trade(_account, _signal, close, _settings)
    
    // Save the updated state
    array.set(G_virtualAccounts, i, _updatedAccount)

// --- UI RENDERING (ON LAST BAR ONLY) ---
if barstate.islast
    VBT.f_render_analytics(G_virtualAccounts, myTable)
This hybrid architecture provides the clean separation you need, is highly performant, and aligns with Pine Script's fundamental design principles.
