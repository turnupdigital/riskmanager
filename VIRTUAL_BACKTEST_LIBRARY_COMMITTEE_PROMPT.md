# ü§ñ AI COMMITTEE - VIRTUAL BACKTEST LIBRARY CONSULTATION

## üìã **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

We're developing a Pine Script trading strategy that needs individual signal performance tracking. After struggling with complex in-strategy virtual account systems that interfere with execution, we're considering creating a **Virtual Backtest Library** to handle all individual signal analytics separately from the main strategy.

## üéØ **LIBRARY CONCEPT**

### **Core Idea:**
Create a Pine Script library (`library.new()`) or pure function module that:
- Manages multiple virtual accounts (one per signal)
- Processes signals independently from main strategy
- Provides clean interface for performance analytics
- Eliminates interference with actual trade execution

### **Current Problem:**
Our in-strategy virtual account system (10 parallel virtual accounts) is causing:
- Exit method failures in main strategy
- Complex debugging scenarios
- Performance concerns
- Maintenance difficulties
`
## üîç **SPECIFIC LIBRARY REQUIREMENTS**

### **Must Handle:**
1. **Multiple Virtual Accounts** (up to 10 different signals)
2. **Individual P&L Tracking** (long/short, in dollars, tick-size aware)
3. **Drawdown Calculations** (max drawdown per signal)
4. **Win Rate & Trade Count** (accurate statistics)
5. **Real-time or Near Real-time Updates** (1-2 day delay acceptable)

### **Interface Needs:**
```pinescript
// Initialization
virtualManager = VirtualBacktest.init(signalNames, settings)

// Per-bar processing
VirtualBacktest.processSignals(virtualManager, signalArray, priceData)

// Results display
VirtualBacktest.renderAnalytics(virtualManager, tablePosition)
```

## ü§î **KEY QUESTIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE**

### **1. Pine Script Library Architecture:**
- Is `library.new()` the right approach for this use case?
- What are the performance implications of Pine Script libraries?
- Are there limitations we should know about (data persistence, array sizes, etc.)?
- Should we use pure functions instead of a formal library?

### **2. Data Management:**
- How should we handle virtual account state across bars?
- What's the best way to store historical performance data in Pine Script?
- Are there memory/performance limits we need to consider?
- How do we handle parameter changes that require virtual account resets?

### **3. Signal Processing:**
- What's the most efficient way to process multiple signals per bar?
- How do we ensure virtual trades stay perfectly synchronized with main strategy conditions?
- Should virtual processing happen before or after main strategy logic?
- How do we handle complex entry/exit conditions in virtual accounts?

### **4. Performance Optimization:**
- What Pine Script best practices apply to library development?
- How do we minimize computational impact on main strategy?
- Are there specific functions or approaches that are more efficient?
- Should we batch process virtual trades or handle them individually?

### **5. Error Handling & Debugging:**
- How do we debug library functions when they're imported?
- What's the best way to handle errors without affecting main strategy?
- Should the library have its own debug/logging system?
- How do we validate that virtual results match expected behavior?

## üí° **SPECIFIC AREAS WHERE WE NEED GUIDANCE**

### **Technical Implementation:**
1. **Library Structure** - Best practices for organizing Pine Script library code
2. **State Management** - Handling persistent data across bars in libraries
3. **Interface Design** - Clean API between main strategy and library
4. **Performance** - Optimization techniques for real-time processing
5. **Testing** - How to validate library functionality

### **Pine Script Specifics:**
1. **Library Limitations** - What can't be done in Pine Script libraries?
2. **Data Types** - Best practices for complex data structures in libraries
3. **Import/Export** - Efficient data passing between strategy and library
4. **Version Management** - How to handle library updates
5. **Distribution** - Best practices for sharing/maintaining libraries

### **Alternative Approaches:**
1. **Pure Functions** - Would a function-based approach be simpler?
2. **Hybrid Solutions** - Combining library and in-strategy components
3. **External Tools** - Should we consider non-Pine Script solutions?
4. **Modular Design** - Breaking functionality into multiple smaller libraries

## üõ†Ô∏è **CURRENT TECHNICAL CONTEXT**

### **Main Strategy Requirements:**
- Multi-signal entry system (10 different indicators)
- Multiple exit strategies (MA Exit, Trailing Stop, Trend Exit, Fixed SL/TP)
- Real-time trade execution with TradingView strategy functions
- Complex filtering systems (Bollinger Bands, RBW, directional bias)

### **Virtual System Needs:**
- Track each signal's performance independently
- Calculate accurate P&L using `syminfo.pointvalue` and tick size
- Handle both long and short positions
- Provide comparative analytics (which signals work best)
- Update performance metrics as strategy parameters change

### **Integration Challenges:**
- Virtual system must not interfere with actual trade execution
- Need clean separation between "real" and "virtual" logic
- Performance must remain acceptable for real-time trading
- Debugging must be possible without breaking main strategy

## üéØ **DESIRED OUTCOMES**

### **Primary Goals:**
1. **Clean Separation** - Virtual analytics completely isolated from trade execution
2. **Reliable Performance** - No interference with main strategy functionality  
3. **Accurate Data** - Virtual results that perfectly match actual strategy conditions
4. **Easy Maintenance** - Simple to update, debug, and extend
5. **Reusable Solution** - Library that could benefit other strategies/traders

### **Success Metrics:**
- Main strategy executes trades reliably (all exit methods work)
- Individual signal performance data is accurate and useful
- System performs well enough for real-time trading
- Code is maintainable and debuggable
- Solution could be shared with trading community

## üí≠ **REQUEST FOR EXPERT GUIDANCE**

We need your experience and insights on:

1. **Is this library approach viable** for our use case in Pine Script?
2. **What are the best practices** for Pine Script library development?
3. **What pitfalls should we avoid** when building complex libraries?
4. **Are there simpler alternatives** we should consider first?
5. **What's the most efficient architecture** for this type of virtual backtesting?

### **Specific Technical Questions:**
- How do Pine Script libraries handle complex data structures?
- What's the performance impact of importing and using libraries?
- Are there size or complexity limits for Pine Script libraries?
- How do we handle debugging when code is in an imported library?
- What's the best way to pass large amounts of data between strategy and library?

## üìä **SUPPORTING CONTEXT**

- **Current Strategy Size:** ~1,800 lines (too complex)
- **Target Signals:** 10 different entry indicators
- **Exit Methods:** 4-5 different exit strategies
- **Performance Requirements:** Real-time execution on TradingView
- **Data Needs:** Individual signal P&L, win rates, drawdown, trade counts
