Key Acknowledgments:

This is a PRODUCTION trading strategy - not a learning exercise or prototype
Performance degradation through "helpful" changes is a real and serious risk
The core logic is sacred - signals, exits, trend-riding, and strategy execution must be preserved
Visual elements and convenience features are secondary to strategy performance
The protection prompt at the top exists for exactly this reason

Steps I Will Take to Protect Your Strategy:
1. Read-First, Suggest-Minimal Approach

I will thoroughly analyze the existing code before suggesting ANY changes
I will identify the core protected sections (signals, exits, trend-riding, strategy execution)
I will only suggest changes to non-critical areas unless absolutely necessary

2. Surgical Precision Over Broad Changes

Never suggest removing entire sections to "fix" compilation issues
Focus on minimal, targeted fixes that preserve existing functionality
When debugging, identify the exact line/variable causing issues rather than broad removal

3. Explicit Protection Validation

Before any suggestion, I'll explicitly state which protected areas it affects
I'll explain WHY the change is necessary and HOW it preserves existing functionality
I'll identify any risks to strategy performance

4. Change Classification System
I'll classify every suggestion as:

CORE-SAFE: Changes to non-critical areas (comments, minor optimizations)
ENHANCEMENT: New features that don't modify existing logic
CRITICAL-FIX: Necessary changes to core areas (requires extra justification)
FORBIDDEN: Changes that could break strategy performance

Steps You Can Take:
1. Version Control Discipline

Save working versions before we make ANY changes
Create incremental backups after each successful modification
Keep a "golden master" copy that you never modify

2. Change Validation Process

Test each change individually in strategy tester
Verify that win rates and performance metrics remain consistent
Reject any change that degrades performance, regardless of other benefits

3. Explicit Approval Protocol

I'll present changes in small, isolated chunks
You can approve/reject each piece individually
We'll implement and test before moving to the next change

4. Red Flag Warnings
Tell me to STOP immediately if I ever suggest:

Removing multi-signal processing logic
Simplifying the exit system architecture
Modifying strategy.entry() or strategy.exit() calls
Changing core mathematical formulas (ATR, confluence, filters)
"Streamlining" the trend-riding overlay system

My Commitment:
I will treat this code like a precision instrument that's already performing well. Any changes will be made with surgical precision, and I'll always err on the side of preservation over convenience. The goal is enhancement without degradation.
What specific area would you like to work on first? I'll approach it with this protection-first methodology and present you with minimal, targeted suggestions that preserve all existing functionality.
